sys.node ->while creating a node in the system we should be -> remove function checking as user may wany to add the same function with different name. 
sys.draw_graph() ->Make the Graph Representatino properly, Tools with different colors/shape and ray-tasks/actor into other color.
In the ETool/EAgent class there should be a method that will simply run the tool some how, and if the tools/agents are http type then create a function that will do function calls.
Also make the load_tool/load_agent method in the Registry class async so that we can asynchronously clone the agents and the tools.
The agent/tool repo should have a YAML file named exactly same as the repo, not only this the YAML File should contain the json for the Base State(model that will be passed inside the langgraph)
And every time we load any agent we firstly check for the YAML file if that is not there the agent/tool can not be used.
There should be some mechansim to delete the downloaded agents/tools if they are not in the use.
Cache the loaded_reference into some where and then if the system recompiled we use the same loaded references.
If there is some changes we will realese the loaded_reference and then compile a new graph.
